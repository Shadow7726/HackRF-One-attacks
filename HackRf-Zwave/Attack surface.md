# Summary of Z-Wave Network Attack Surface and Vulnerabilities

## Radio Frequency Layer

- **Packet sniffing/interception**: Attackers intercept wireless packets to gather information or launch subsequent attacks.
- **Packet injection**: Malicious packets injected into the network disrupt normal operations (e.g., Hel Attack, manipulation of Find Nodes in Range command).

## Routing Layer

- **Black hole attacks**: Compromised routing nodes drop all packets, halting network connectivity.
- **Sinkhole attacks**: Manipulated nodes attract and control network traffic for analysis or manipulation.

## Gateway Layer

- **Lack of access control**: Gateways lack authentication, allowing unauthorized entry. Vulnerabilities enable remote code execution.
  
## Device Layer

- **Lack of input validation**: Devices accept unvalidated inputs, leading to malformed commands and denial-of-service attacks.

## Cryptography

- **Weak encryption schemes**: Vulnerable encryption in Z-Wave devices permits key extraction and brute force attacks.
- **Insecure Update Mechanisms:** Lack of authentication enables malicious firmware injection.
- **Lack of Rollback Protection:** Devices vulnerable to downgrades to insecure firmware versions.
